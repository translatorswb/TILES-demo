# TILES demo

A static simple front-end/back-end for TILES

## Installation & Usage with docker compose

The docker setup runs all the components needed for TILES: 

1. The web app
2. Rhasspy backend
3. OpenTTS

Make sure you specify the language code for Rhasspy and OpenTTS in the docker compose file. Check supported languages of [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#supported-languages) and [OpenTTS](https://github.com/synesthesiam/opentts) before. 

To build and run:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

## Installation & Usage

In this setup you'd need to run [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/) (and OpenTTS if needed) separately. 

Clone repository and install required modules
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/translatorswb/TILES-demo.git
$ cd TILES-demo
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server

```bash
$ uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

or simply
```bash
$ bash run.sh
```

## Setting up answers and audio

The current TILES demo functions as a Q&A system. The answers need to be specified in a `tsv` format file. Two examples can be seen under `data` directory.

The answers of the audio can be placed under a directory with the same id as the answers in the `tsv` file. It's also possible to use TTS for all or unrecorded answers. In that case the environment variable `TTSFALLBACK` needs to be `1`. 

## Setting up video

TILES plays a video while no interaction is being made. The location of this video is specified in this line of the file `static/tiles.html`:

```html
  <source src="static/TILES_withspeech.mp4" type="video/mp4">
```
